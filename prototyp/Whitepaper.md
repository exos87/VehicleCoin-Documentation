# VehicleCoin Whitepaper

## Introduction

VehicleCoin is a cryptocurrency designed to incentivize ownership and use of environmentally friendly vehicles, with rewards linked to eco-friendly practices. Our aim is to foster a green transition in transportation within the EU and, eventually, globally.

## Objectives and Goals

VehicleCoin (VHC) is a new cryptocurrency concept that ties its value to the ownership and use of transportation vehicles. The core idea is that each eco-friendly vehicle you own – be it a car, an electric scooter, or any registered motorized vehicle – is linked to a certain amount of VHC. The goal is to motivate ownership of green vehicles by assigning higher value to tokens associated with environmentally friendly technologies. Additional bonuses will be provided for the recycling or sale of non-eco-friendly vehicles.

## Funding and Monetization

### Funding Sources:
1. **Investors and Venture Capital:**
   - **Private Investors:** Engaging private and angel investors who are interested in technology and ecological projects.
   - **Venture Capital:** Targeting venture capital funds focused on innovation and sustainable development.

2. **Crowdfunding and ICO:**
   - **ICO (Initial Coin Offering):** Launching an ICO where investors can purchase VehicleCoin tokens prior to the project launch.
   - **Crowdfunding Platforms:** Leveraging crowdfunding platforms to raise public funds.

3. **EU Grants and Funds:**
   - **EU Grant Programs:** Securing funding from EU programs aimed at ecological innovation and digitalization.
   - **National Grant Programs:** Utilizing national grant programs to support ecological and technological innovations.

### Monetization Model:
1. **Transaction Fees:** Collecting small fees for each transaction processed on the VehicleCoin network.
2. **Partnerships:** Establishing partnerships with eco-friendly businesses and governmental entities that encourage sustainable practices.

## Technology Stack

VehicleCoin is built on the Solana blockchain to ensure high-speed, cost-effective transactions. The platform utilizes smart contracts to handle eco-reward systems and verify vehicle registration.

## Roadmap

The initial phase of VehicleCoin targets EU citizens and businesses, with a specific focus on Slovakia due to accessible EU funds. The roadmap includes plans for expansion beyond the EU once the project reaches maturity.

### Phase 1: EU Launch (Year 1)
- Launch VehicleCoin in select EU countries, focusing on green incentives and partnerships with local governments and businesses.

### Phase 2: Global Expansion (Year 2-3)
- Expand beyond the EU, establishing partnerships globally to promote VehicleCoin adoption.
