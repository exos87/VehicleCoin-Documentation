## Problem Statement
Today's vehicle data and ownership records are scattered, insecure, and provide no rewards for eco-friendly choices. VehicleCoin aims to solve this.

## Solution Overview
With VehicleCoin, we’re building a secure, blockchain-backed system that brings transparency to vehicle data and rewards users for environmentally conscious actions. Using Java (Spring Boot) for robust backend processing, Angular for a smooth user interface, and the efficient Solana blockchain for eco-incentivized transactions, VehicleCoin offers a transformative experience.

## Tokenomics
### How We Generate Value
1. **Transaction Fees**: Every transaction is a micro-contribution to sustaining the VehicleCoin ecosystem.
2. **Eco-Incentives**: Get rewarded for behaviors that reduce your carbon footprint, like carpooling or using electric vehicles.

### Value Stability
To ensure a stable ecosystem, VehicleCoin utilizes:
- **Token Burn Mechanism**: A portion of fees is permanently removed from circulation.
- **Reserve Fund**: Set aside for maintaining market stability and supporting eco-partners.

## Security & Compliance
### Legal Assurance and Data Protection
Our solution complies with the EU’s strict data privacy standards (GDPR) and meets blockchain regulations, ensuring a lawful and safe ecosystem.

### Security Protocols
Advanced cryptographic algorithms and multi-layer security protect user data and assets, giving our community peace of mind.
